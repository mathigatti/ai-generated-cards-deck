I have a list of sentences, for each, generate a visual description that might be a good illustration of that sentence. It doesn't need to be exactly it but it should be related. The sentences are in spanish but the visual description should be in english.

Example:

Sentence: "Recibí mimos"

It turns into this visual image
"A man resting in the grass on a sunny day, enjoying receiving caresses from some enthusiastic friends. The scene portrays a relaxed and joyful atmosphere, with the man lying comfortably in the grass, surrounded by friends who are affectionately interacting with him. The friends are shown in a manner that reflects their enthusiasm and camaraderie. The setting is a peaceful outdoor scene, capturing the essence of a sunny day."


These are the sentences:

Contar una fantasía 
Decile algo sucio a alguien al oido
Ronda de nalgadas
Bailar pegadito
Besar a alguien en cualquier lado menos los labios
Masaje a otra persona (donde quiera)
30 segundos de nalgueadas y cosquillas
Mirarse fijo por 30 segundos con alguien
